# Face Recognition and Detection Project

## Overview
This project is designed to implement advanced algorithms for face recognition and detection. It aims to accurately identify and track faces in real-time.

## Features
- **Face Detection**: This feature locates and identifies faces in an image or video stream.
- **Face Recognition**: This component compares detected faces against a known database to identify individuals.

## Files in the Repository
- `Face Recognition And Detection.mp4`: A demonstration video showing the project's capabilities.
- `main.py`: The main Python script that orchestrates the face detection and recognition processes.
- `recognition.py`: Contains the algorithms and models used for recognizing faces.

## Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt
run recognition.py
